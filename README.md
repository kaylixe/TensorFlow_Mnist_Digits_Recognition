# Mnist Digit Recognition Using Tensorflow

The MNIST problem is a dataset developed by Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes and Christopher Burges for evaluating machine learning models on the handwritten digit classification problem.

The dataset was constructed from a number of scanned document dataset available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This is where the name for the dataset comes from, as the Modified NIST or MNIST dataset.

This project will explore the different handwritten digits using python. A simple DNN model will be created to recognize sample digits with an accuracy of about 98%. PCA and t-SNE will also be used for dimensionality reduction and to visualize the digits.
